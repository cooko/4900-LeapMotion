API Results
	Leap Motion comes with access to the developer kit
		collection of libraries and sample programs to use in development
	Complete API is avaiable online through their site
		outlines the basics archatecture and specific functions of the the leap motion
	Bindings existed many languages
	Unexpected learning overhead
		windows development
		languages
		gui issues

Sample Applications
	Developed 6 sample/demonstration applications
	Used to learn the major parts of the leap motion
		Gesture control
		Finger tracking
		3d space navigation
		2d space navigation

Usage Research
	Explored some potential future uses
	Focused on specific catagories
		Education
		OS control
		Video games
		Rehabilitation

	Overview of results
		A lot of work is being done
		active community of developers
		wide range of applications
		mostly in the rudementury/experimental stages
		mostly seems like proofs of concepts more than complete applications
		people doing the same thing as me


Rehab software
	Focus of project
	design an application that can assist in range of motion rehabilitation
		Quantitativly track improvements over time.
	took some research
		what is range of motion
		how is it calculated
		is it possible to emulate

	Overview
		Active range-of-motion calculation using the leap motion controller
		unassisted diagnostic
		angle that your finger travels relative to the joint
		Performed with a goniometer
			used to measure the angle that your finger moves

	Implementation
		replicate a goniometer
		tracks using inverse trigonomics the angle of movement
			from palm position to tip of finger
		records these for access later

	Challenges
		Joint tracking
			fingers are broken into sections
			Leap motion only tracks the finger as a whole
				end point and palm location only
		Occlusion
			the leapmotion is unable to detect the finger during its complete movement
		Stabilization
			passive movement in the hand
