some issues:

	finger range of motion is measured in angles of the different parts of the finger
		the leap motion only provides information about the finger tip
		Some sort of inverse kinimatics might be required to solve this7

	full skeleton recognition is planned for future updates


	        - 15-20 minutes
        - include the problem you were investigating

			Active range-of-motion calculation using the leap motion controller

        - include what you want to do with this (medical apps, and what’s been done already - be brief though)
        - include the things you had to learn - be specific and technical about this
        	Languages
        		Javascript
        		C++
        		Windows Programming
        		Leap Motion API
        		Range of motion
        - include some examples of things you’ve developed (perhaps pong via Leap?)
        - end with what you think you can do with the device in the future
        
        - the problem description and the medical app stuff should take 5-10 minutes. 
        - the things you learned (give examples) should be about 10 minutes
        - then save 5 minutes for wowing us with whatever you’ve developed
